# Problem Gambling Analysis: Logistic Regression Exploration

## Overview
I wanted to explore logistic regression and predictive modelling using real-world survey data. This project examines socio-economic and behavioural factors that may influence the status of problem gambling in England and Scotland. The goal was to experiment with **binary classification**, **predictive analysis**, and **interpretable statistical modelling**.

Throughout this project, I focused on building a logistic regression model, evaluating its predictive performance, and understanding which variables have meaningful effects on the probability of being a problem gambler.

## Repository Contents

- `data/` - The cleaned dataset used for analysis.  
- `code/` - R scripts performing exploratory data analysis, model building, and diagnostics.  
- `report & output/` - My PDF report summarising findings and methodology.  

## Key Features
- Logistic regression for binary outcomes (problem gambling).  
- Confusion matrix and predictive evaluation with attention to class imbalance.  
- Odds ratios and average predictive comparisons for easy-to-interpret results.  
- Data preprocessing including merging categories, re-levelling factors, and handling missing values.  

## Technologies Used
- **R** (for data manipulation, analysis, and modelling)  
- **tidyverse / dplyr / ggplot2** (for data wrangling and visualization)  
- **statistics** (for data analysis)
